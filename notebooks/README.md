# Data Exploration and Download Notebooks

The notebooks in this directory are the experimental launch points for the image utilities in `../image_utils` and `../scripts`. They also have some preliminary image analysis in them. It's probably stupid, and is definitely wrong. 

## `pipeline-all-with-download.py`
Contains all of the code which went into understanding the Planet API, and uses some abstractions around it for simplicity. 

## `data-extract.py`
Experimental code for extracting neighboring pixels from images around ground-truth measurement sites and outputting a CSV. 

## `data-exploration.py`
Contains code for initial exploratory data analysis, including some histograms of snow-on vs snow-off conditions and some clustering.
